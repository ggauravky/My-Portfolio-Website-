## 🎨 Logos & Branding

You can include logos or icons in your README by putting image files into `assets/` and referencing them here. For example:

```md
![My Logo](assets/logo.jpg)
```

You can also add technology logos (e.g. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) using shields or small icons.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ggauravky/My-Portfolio-Website-.git

2. Serve via a local HTTP server (needed because the site uses `fetch` to load JSON):

     ```sh

     ```
   - Or use **VS Code Live Server** plugin.

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port used by your server).

4. Edit content:
   - Update `data/projects.json`, `data/skills.json`, `blog.json`
   - Replace images in `assets/`
